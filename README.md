# TSNES

This project is one I made for fun in my spare time. Emulation of CPU, PPU, data Bus, and rendering are all complete, but the main game loop still needs to more work, mainly throttling to 60FPS in order to make the emulator playable on browsers.

### TODO: Important features to implement

1. APU/sound emulation
2. Mapper support

## TODO: Nice to have features
1. Using web workers(or any viable alternatives) to multithread application, further optimizing the emulator

Until then, here are some screenshots of the extracted sprite data from the Pacman CHR ROM:

Stay tuned...
